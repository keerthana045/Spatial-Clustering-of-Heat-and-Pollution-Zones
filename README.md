# Spatial-Clustering-of-Heat-and-Pollution-Zones-
This project investigates the spatial relationship between heat and air pollution by applying unsupervised clustering techniques to environmental data. 
Using datasets that include temperature and pollutant levels (such as PM2.5 and NOâ‚‚), the project identifies geographical clusters of environmental stress. 
By comparing heat and pollution zones, it aims to determine whether high pollution levels contribute to elevated temperatures, especially in urban areas.
The findings can assist urban planners and environmental researchers in designing targeted climate mitigation and pollution control strategies.
